## Description

This is the second project for [Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011). The aim of this project is to understand how to manipulate the DOM and add contents dynamically to the page. Used Udacity's starter code for HTML and CSS and I wrote JavaScript to make its static page dynamic.

* Dynamically add sections
* Dynamically create navigation bar
* Highlight Sections corresponding sections are in the viewport in the function `makeActive()`.
* Implemented Event Listeners to got to any section we click
